# ConsoleProgress

Allows you to show the progress of your scripts in the taskbar, like native Windows file copy operations do.

## Usage

```
Usage:
        ConsoleProgress [ reset | indeterminate | flash | [ normal | warning | error ] [ 0-100 ] ]

Usage examples:

        ConsoleProgress reset         - returns the console to normal
        ConsoleProgress indeterminate - sets the state to indeterminate
        ConsoleProgress normal 25     - sets the state to normal and the progress to 25%
        ConsoleProgress warning       - sets the state to warning without changing the progress
        ConsoleProgress 100           - sets the progress to 100% without changing the state
        ConsoleProgress flash         - flash to get the user's attention
```
